# Data-Driven-Location-Analysis-for-Optimal-Restaurant-Placement-in-India
In a bustling city like Pune, India, the strategic placement of a new restaurant can significantly impact its success. Leveraging data science methodologies, I embarked on a comprehensive analysis to identify the optimal location for such an establishment. By integrating various techniques including web scraping, data cleaning, machine learning, and visualization, I aimed to provide actionable insights to stakeholders.

My approach began with scraping data from the MakeMyTrip webpage to compile a comprehensive list of neighborhoods in Pune. Next, I obtained their geographical coordinates to facilitate further analysis. Utilizing the Foursquare API, I gathered venue data, with a specific focus on existing restaurants in each neighborhood.

The crux of my methodology lay in employing machine learning, specifically K-means clustering, to analyze the collected data. By clustering neighborhoods based on similarities in restaurant offerings and other relevant factors, I aimed to identify clusters representing potential optimal locations for a new restaurant.

Furthermore, I ensured data integrity and consistency through rigorous cleaning and wrangling processes, thus enhancing the reliability and accuracy of the analysis. To present my findings effectively, I utilized visualization tools such as Folium to create interactive maps, allowing stakeholders to intuitively explore the results.

Ultimately, my work aimed to provide valuable insights to decision-makers in the restaurant industry, enabling them to make informed decisions regarding the placement of new establishments in Pune. By leveraging data science methodologies, I strive to contribute to the optimization of business strategies and the enhancement of overall success in the dynamic and competitive landscape of the restaurant industry.
